# Parse Tree Visualizer

Parse Tree Visualizer is a tool that converts popular high-level programming languages into parse trees and provides visual representations. It helps developers understand how the code is structured by showing its hierarchical syntax in a tree form.

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports languages like Python, C++, JavaScript, Java, and more.
- **Parse Tree Generation**: Generates parse trees based on the input code.
- **Tree Visualization**: Provides an easy-to-understand, graphical representation of the parse tree.
- **Error Detection**: Identifies syntax errors and provides detailed error messages.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Allows users to interact with the parse tree (expand/collapse nodes, hover for details).

## How It Works

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Breaks down the source code into tokens (keywords, operators, identifiers).
2. **Parsing**: Constructs the parse tree by applying language-specific grammar rules.
3. **Tree Visualization**: Displays the parse tree in a graphical format.
4. **Error Handling**: Highlights any syntax errors found during parsing and provides feedback.
